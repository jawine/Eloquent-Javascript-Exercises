I am sharing my solutions to the code exercises in Haverbeke's fantastic book in hopes that
others working through the exercises might benefit from my solutions or offer advice for improving them.
Minimally, I will try to develop my own working (if messy) solution before looking to the book resources or outside help.

Current progress:

Chapter 02 code exercises initial commit 11/29/16:  
- See ch02/looping_a_triangle.js, ch02/fizz_buzz.js, and ch02/chess_board.js  
- Not very happy with my solution for the Chess Board problem  
- I need to refactor chessBoard() so that odd-numbered "width" arguments passed into chessBoard() provide the expected number of columns
